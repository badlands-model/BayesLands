## Overview
**BayesLands**, a Bayesian framework for [**Badlands**](https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands) that fuses information obtained from complex forward models with observational data and prior knowledge. As a proof-of-concept, we consider a synthetic and real-world topography with two free  parameters, namely precipitation and erodibility, that we need to estimate through BayesLands. The results of the experiments shows that BayesLands yields a promising distribution of the  parameters. Moreover, the challenge in sampling due to multi-modality is presented through visualizing a likelihood surface that has a  range of suboptimal modes.
